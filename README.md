## Machine Learning
"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" - Arthur Samuel (1959).

The two main types of machine learning are supervised learning and unsupervised learning. 

## Supervised Learning
Supervised Machine Learning or more commonly, supervised learning, refers to algorithms that learn on input data that has been labeled for a particular output.

The key characteristic is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from. That includes the "right answers" or the correct label y for a given input x. The algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and try to produce the appropriate corresponding output y.

Supervised learning algorithms primarily generate two kinds of results: classification and regression.

### Regression
Aims to learn relationships and correlations between input variables and the one continuous output variable with the scope of predicting that continuous output variable.

### Classificacion
Aims to learn relationships between input variables and the output variable with the scope of separating the data into classes or groups, the output variable is categorical or discrete.
